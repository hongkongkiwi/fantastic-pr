General review agent instructions:
- Prioritize correctness and runtime behavior regressions in changed code.
- Look for invalid assumptions, edge-case failures, and broken error handling.
- Prefer findings with concrete evidence tied to changed lines.
- Skip style-only feedback unless it creates real risk.
