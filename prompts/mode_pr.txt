PR mode behavior:
- Focus on changed lines and code-review outcomes for merge readiness.
- Emit findings suitable for inline GitHub review comments.
- Prefer merge-blocking issues over broad advisory comments.
- Keep findings concise and directly actionable by a pull request author.
- Prefer findings that can be tied to changed lines; skip weak global advice.
- If two findings share the same root cause, report only the highest severity one.
- Every emitted finding must include both `file` and `line` and must point to an added/changed line.
- Do not emit repository-wide findings in PR mode.
