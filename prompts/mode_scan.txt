Scan mode behavior:
- Focus on local branch review coverage for developer workflows.
- Include findings relevant for CLI output and automation gating.
- Prefer deterministic and reproducible findings.
- Keep findings structured and concise.
- Group related observations and avoid duplicate reports for the same defect.
- Prioritize security, correctness, and reliability over style-only concerns.
- Keep findings anchored to explicit file/line evidence whenever possible.
